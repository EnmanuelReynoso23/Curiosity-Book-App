# Curiosity eBook Reader App
> This was a personal project, made out of the curiosity to read books and the unavailability of good e-book readers with the note taking functionality that I wanted.<br/>

The app has the following features:<br/>

1. Download any book you like.
2. Save the books in the app itself.
3. Read with a built-in pdf Reader.
4. Create Notes, with features like Adding Tags to track important Highlights/Notes.

## Steps to Start
Feel free to pull and use the app. Run the following commands:

```javascript
npm install 
```
```javascript
react-native run-android 
```
```javascript
react-native start
```

## PS:
I have changes some part of the app, due to copyright issues and stuff, but you can still use the template, UI, etc. of the app to mix and match to create your own version of the app.
